This is the start of an Elixir port of the [ActiveSupport Rubygem]. [Contributions
welcome].

 [ActiveSupport Rubygem]:https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport
 [Contributions welcome]:https://github.com/mykewould/crutches#new-to-elixir

Contributions are especially welcomed! Take a look at `[CONTRIBUTING.md]` for
more information.

### Compatability and versioning

We test against the following combinations of Erlang/OTP and Elixir. Other
combinations are not officially supported.

 - Erlang/OTP `18.0` and Elixir `1.0.5`

This project is still alpha software. APIs and supported Elixir and/or Erlang
versions may change at a moments notice. Use with discretion.

### Documentation

The following places contain documentation on Crutches:

 - [API reference] on Hexdocs, the standard Elixir documentation hoster.
 - [Wiki]&mdash;still under construction.

 [API reference]:http://hexdocs.pm/crutches/
 [Wiki]:https://github.com/mykewould/crutches/wiki

### New to Elixir?

This library is a great for Elixir beginners to contribute to. We are porting
over ActiveSupport, an addition to the standard library of the Ruby programming
language. Most of the function documentation and specs have been written already.
This allows the contributor to focus on the syntax and nuances of Elixir. The
bonus here is that the contributor will be helping an open source project while
learning the basics.

Take a look at `[CONTRIBUTING.md]` for more information on how you can get
started.

#### Why ActiveSupport?

ActiveSupport has some great goodies that are useful in web application
development. Furthermore the design pattern for ActiveSupport, and it's use
cases, are not hard to understand. If you are coming from the Rails community,
being a contributor on this project shouldn't be overly difficult. And if you're
not, just give it a try!
